## This is the first semester course of post graduate students in ASTU. 
The main text book is "Stochastic Processes, Estimation and Control" by J.Sprey.2008.The text book is introdcuced 
the essence of the optimal estimation of stochastic processes, in addition to those in the text book, I will 
introduce recent developed non-linear Kalman filter as 'Unsecented Kalman filter".
